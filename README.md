# Working Edits

"Shrimply the best."

this repo is my dev channel for the origami theme. it is also my personal ‘daily driver’ edits. it’s intended to be used ‘as is’ or with snippets and only offers minimal style settings for color themes. fonts are softcoded to martian mono and space grotesk for monospace and editor respectively. titles, h1, and h2 all are hard coded to nightingale from death of typography.

edits revolve around creating a minimal writing environment with a tactile and slightly magical bias.

## todo
- title/h1/h2 override snippet
- split canvas into snippet
- split callouts into snippet
- add reference links to above
